# terraform-github-team

[![Terraform Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/terraform-1.x-623CE4.svg?logo=terraform)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases)
[![Github Provider Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/GH-6.x-F8991D.svg?logo=terraform)](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github/releases)

## Fork Notice

This is a maintained fork of [mineiros-io/terraform-github-team](https://github.com/mineiros-io/terraform-github-team), which is no longer actively maintained. The goal of this fork is to bring the module up to GitHub Provider v6 compatibility and continue ongoing maintenance.

**Attention**: This module requires the `integrations/github` provider and is incompatible with the deprecated `hashicorp/github` provider.

## Warning

**Warning**: As this repository is being brough up to GitHub provider v6, it is
currently not ready for production, development only. Breaking changes can and
will be introduced in the meantime. You've been warned.

## Description

A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) module for creating and managing [GitHub Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) including memberships and repository access.

This module supports Terraform v1.x and is compatible with the Official Terraform GitHub Provider v6.x from `integrations/github`.

Originally developed by [Mineiros](https://github.com/mineiros-io), this fork aims to:

- Update compatibility to GitHub Provider v6
- Fix outstanding issues and bugs
- Continue active maintenance and development

In contrast to using individual GitHub provider resources, this module provides a convenient wrapper that manages teams, nested teams, memberships, and repository permissions in a cohesive and tested way.

## Features

- **Default Security Settings**: Secret team visibility by default
- **Standard Team Features**: Team creation, description, privacy settings, nested teams, LDAP sync
- **Extended Team Features**: Team memberships (members and maintainers), repository access with granular permissions (admin, maintain, push, triage, pull)

## Getting Started

Most basic usage creating a GitHub team:

```hcl
module "team" {
  source  = "rad-jan/team/github"
  version = "~> 0.9.0"

  name        = "DevOps"
  description = "The DevOps Team"
  privacy     = "secret"

  members     = ["developer-1", "developer-2"]
  maintainers = ["team-lead"]
}
```

## Usage

See [variables.tf](variables.tf) and [examples/](examples/) for detailed use-cases.

The intended behavior is to enforce the state of teams and their configurations. If you modify resources outside of Terraform and reapply the state, conflicting configurations will be overwritten.

For comprehensive documentation on module arguments, outputs, and advanced configurations, see [MODULE_REFERENCE.md](docs/MODULE_REFERENCE.md).

  privacy     = "closed"

  # Team members
  members = [
    "developer-1",
    "developer-2",
  ]

  # Team maintainers
  maintainers = [
    "tech-lead",
  ]

  # Repository permissions
  admin_repositories = [
    "backend-core",
  ]

  push_repositories = [
    "backend-api",
    "backend-services",
  ]

  pull_repositories = [
    "frontend-app",
    "shared-libs",
  ]
}
```

### Nested Teams

```hcl
module "engineering" {
  source = "rad-jan/team/github"

  name        = "Engineering"
  description = "All engineering staff"
  privacy     = "closed"
}

module "backend" {
  source = "rad-jan/team/github"

  name           = "Backend"
  description    = "Backend engineering team"
  privacy        = "closed"
  parent_team_id = module.engineering.id

  members     = ["backend-dev-1", "backend-dev-2"]
  maintainers = ["backend-lead"]
}

module "frontend" {
  source = "rad-jan/team/github"

  name           = "Frontend"
  description    = "Frontend engineering team"
  privacy        = "closed"
  parent_team_id = module.engineering.id

  members     = ["frontend-dev-1", "frontend-dev-2"]
  maintainers = ["frontend-lead"]
}
```
